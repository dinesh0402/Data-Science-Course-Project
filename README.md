# Data Science Course Project ðŸ“ˆâš½
***
In this project, I carried out an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), on the game statitics of the players in the English Premeir League (EPL) and draw some interesting insights into the player origins, their performances, their records and other such stats to see who rules the EPL with their presence on the pitch. I have further predicted the match outcomes of the EPL matches using the previous 2 season's data.

Some of the Python libraries used here are:
- Scikit Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- NumPy and Pandas
